# GHLH 2 - Grčko-hrvatski i latinsko-hrvatski korpus, verzija 2

Greek-Croatian and Latin-Croatian aligned corpus, version 2

## The project

We are aligning a large number of sentences from Greek and Latin texts with their Croatian translations. We are experimenting with translations: some are literal, and prepared especially for the GHLH project, the other versions are translations published in books. At the same time, we are thinking about [rules and guidelines for alignment](guidelines-alignment-ghlh.md) of text and translation.
